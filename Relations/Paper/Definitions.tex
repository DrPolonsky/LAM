\section{Definitions}
\label{sec:Definitions}
The following definitions are provided to ensure clarity and precision
in our discussion. Each subsection specifies the Agda file(s) which contain formalizations of the given definitions.

\begin{definition}
    An abstract rewrite system (\emph{ARS}) is a structure $\mathcal{A} = (A, R_\alpha)$ where
     $A$ is a set of elements and $R_\alpha$ is a set of binary relations on $A$.
\end{definition}

For the rest of this section, let $A$ be a fixed set, and $R$ be a relation on $A$.
(In the Agda code supplement, this is represented by a type $A : \bset$,
and a binary type family $R : A \to A \to \bset$.)

% \greyout{We denote by $\tilde R$ the relational converse of $R$ ($(x,y) \in \tilde R \iff (y,x) \in R$),
% and by $R;R'$ the relational composition of $R$ and $R'$.}

\subsection{Closure operators (\texttt{ClosureOperators.agda})}
\begin{notation}
  The following notions are standard.  For precise definitions,
  see \texttt{ClosureOperators.agda}.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item $R^r$ denotes the \emph{reflexive closure} of $R$.
    \item $R^s$ denotes the \emph{symmetric closure} of $R$.
    \item $\tclos{R}$ denotes the \emph{transitive closure} of $R$.
    \item $R^* = (R^r)\tclos{}$ denotes the \emph{reflexive-transitive closure} of $R$.
    \item $R^= = (R^s)^*$ denotes the \emph{equivalence relation generated by} $R$.
  \end{enumerate}
\end{notation}




In the context of abstract rewriting, we will often write $a \rstep b$
in place of $(a,b) \in R$.  Similarly, we will write $a \mstep b$ for $(a,b) \in R^*$,
$a \bstep b$ for $(b,a) \in R$.  When the relation $R$ is clear from the context,
we may drop the corresponding subscript.

We next define rewriting-theoretic concepts like confluence and normalization relative to a fixed element of $A$; global versions of these properties are obtained by universal quantification.
\subsection{Normalization (\texttt{ARS-Properties.agda})}
\begin{definition} The following definitions relate to normalization. Let $A$ and $R$ be as above, and let $a \in A$.
  \begin{description}
    \item[$a \in \NF_R$] \emph{$a$ is a normal form} if $(a,b) \notin R$ for any $b \in A$ 
    \item[$a \in \WN_R$] \emph{$a$ is weakly normalizing} if $a \mstep b$ for some $b \in \NF_R$.
    \item[$a \in \SN_R$] \emph{$a$ is strongly normalizing} if $a$ is accessible with respect to the converse relation $\bar{R} = {(y,x) | (x,y) \in R}$. See Section \ref{sec:Well-foundedness}. 
  \end{description}
\end{definition} 

 

\subsection{Confluence (\texttt{ARS-Properties.agda})}
\begin{definition} The following definitions relate to confluence. Let $A$ and $R$ be as above, and let $a \in A$.
    \begin{description}
        \item[$a \in \WCR_R$] \emph{$a$ is weakly Church-Rosser (or weakly confluent)} if $c \bstep a \rstep b \implies c \mstep d \bmstep b$.
        \item[$a \in \CR_R$] \emph{$a$ is Church-Rosser (or confluent)} if $c \bmstep a \mstep b \implies c \mstep d \bmstep b$.
        \item[$a \in \NPe_R$] \emph{$a$ has the equivalence normal form property} if $a \estep b \implies a\mstep b$ for any $b \in \NF$.
        \item[$a \in \NP_R$] \emph{$a$ has the normal form property} if $c \bmstep a \mstep b \implies c \mstep b$ for any $b \in \NF$. 
        \item[$a \in \UN_R$] \emph{$a$ has the unique normal form property} if $a \estep b \implies a \equiv b$  for any $a, b \in \NF$.
        \item[$a \in \UNto_R$] \emph{$a$ has the unique normal form property with respect to reduction} if $c \bmstep a \mstep b  \implies b \equiv c$  for any $b, c \in \NF$.
    \end{description}
\end{definition}
For each of the subsets defined above we denote in bold face the proposition that the subset contains all of $A$.
That is, for $\mathrm{X} \in \{\WCR , \CR , \NP , \UN \}$ we write $\mathbf{X}$ for the statement that $x \in \mathrm{X}_R$ for all $x \in A$.


In \terese $\NF$ is used to denote $\NPe$, whereas we have chosen to use $\NF$ to denote normal form. Moreover, ${\gNP}$ and ${\gNPe}$ are equivalent when 

\begin{proposition}
    $\NPe \leftrightarrow \NP$ 
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    See, \verb|NP₌↔NP : R isNP₌ ↔ R isNP| in \texttt{ARS-Implications.agda}.
\end{proof}
\begin{proposition}
    $\UN \implies \UNto $
\end{proposition}
\begin{proof}
    See, \verb|UN→UN→ : R isUN → R isUN→| in \texttt{ARS-Implications.agda}
\end{proof}
The implication $\UNto \implies \UN$ does not hold, as can be seen in CE-\ref{CE:un} in Subsection \ref{subsec:counterexamples}.
\subsection{Sequences and Recurrence (\texttt{ARS-Properties.agda}, \texttt{Seq.agda})}
The following definitions are key to formalizing Theorem 1.2.3 in \terese.
$R \models \mathbf{X}$ is $\forall a. a \in \mathrm{X}_R$. When $R$ is clear from the context, we will write $\gNP$ for $R \models \gNP$, etc. \sacomment{Mention this earlier}

\begin{definition}
    \begin{description}
        \item[$R \models Inc$] \emph{$R$ is increasing} if there exists a ``size function'' $|-| : A \to \nat$ satisfying, for all $a, b \in A$,
        $Rab \to |a| < |b|$  
    \end{description}
\end{definition}

\sacomment{motivate here going from above defn to the following.}

\begin{definition} Let $A$ and $R$ be as above, and let $a \in A$.
    \begin{description}
        \item[$s : \nat \to A$] \emph{A sequence $s \in A$} is a function from the natural numbers to $A$.  
        \item[$s \in R-increasing$] \emph{A sequence $s \in A$ is $R$-increasing} if every term is $R$-related to its preceding term.
        \item[$a$ is an $s$-bound] if $s (i) \mstep a$ for all $i \in \nat$. 
        \item[$a \in \BP_R$] if all $R$-increasing sequence $s$ with $s (0) = a$ there exists an $s$-bound. 
        \item[$R \models \RPm$] \emph{$R$ has the weak recurrence property} if for every increasing sequence $s$ with bound $b$ there exists an $i \in \nat$ such that $b \mstep s (i)$.
        \item[$R \models \RP$] \emph{$R$ has the recurrence property} if every bounded, increasing sequence $s$ with an $s$-bound, there exists an $i \in \nat$ such that 
        $s (i) \in \MF$.
    \end{description}
\end{definition}


The following is immediate.
\begin{proposition}\hfill 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item $\Inc \implies \RPm$
        \item $\RPm \implies \RP$
    \end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}


It follows that every relation that is increasing in the sense of \terese
vacuously satisfies the RP condition.

\sacomment{tidy up below on rp iff rp- .}
We investigated $\RP$ and thought that with $\RPm$ we had a candidate for a weaker definition that 
did not rely on the notion of $\MF$. We were able to proove that this weaker definition is 
in fact an equivalent definition in the following proof in Agda:

\subsection{Finitely branching}
\sacomment{This property is what makes a lot of the classical properties valid which otherwise wouldn't be. Valid in most interesting rewriting systems. Most 
programming languages will satisfy finite branching.}
\begin{definition}
    \begin{description}
        \item[TODO] TODO 
    \end{description}
\end{definition}
\sacomment{Anything else to define such as finitely branching?}
