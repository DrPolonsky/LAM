\section{2024.10.24}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Goal: A technical report that focuses on
  Abstract Rewriting in Constructive Setting 
  \item
\end{itemize}

\section{2024.10.10}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Look at restricting WFmin to $\lnot\lnot$-closed predicates
  \item Status of important hypotheses:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Deciding whether a given element $x$ reduces to a given element $y$
      (Is $R$ itself decidable?)
      \item Deciding whether a given element $x$ reduces to some element $y$
      (Is being an $R$-normal form decidable?)

      {\textcolor{red}{This is needed to show that SN $\Rightarrow$ WN.}}

      \item If a given element $x$ is \emph{not} a normal form,
      exhibiting some element $y$ that it reduces to.
      (This is related to DeMorgan/Markov/etc. properties that came up in WF file.)

      \item Does UN-lemma \emph{require} the decidability assumption?
    \end{itemize}
  \item META questions: Which of the ARS theorems can be made ``local/pointwise'',
  for example,
  \begin{itemize}
    \item NL+: $WCR(R) \land SN(x) \to CR(x)$?  (Yes?)
    \item NL++: $WCR(x) \land SN(x) \to CR(x)$? (No.)
  \end{itemize}
  \item When time permits, uniformize the notation (variable names, etc.) to the extent possible.
\end{itemize}

\section{2024.09.19}

TODO item: Compile a list of counterexamples

\section{2024.09.12}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Investigate \texttt{iii-lemma}.  (Is it false, or is there a classical proof?)
  (No constructive proof?)
  \item Look at variations of RP.
  \item What happens if properties involving sequences are reformulated for
  $R^r$? (Cannot decide whether the given sequence is finite or infinite.)
  \item Look at RP- and WCR implies RP!
  \item Can "sequential" properties like RP, RP-, isWFseq, isWFseq-, $\omega$-bounded, etc.,
  be related to the cofinality property.
\end{itemize}

\section{Relations, ARS}


\begin{enumerate}
  \item Define logical and structurual operations on relations, proving laws about them.
  \item Define closure operations on realtions, proving laws about them
  \item Define properties such as transtivity etc.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Well-foundedness}

Four notions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Based on every element being accessible
  \item Every inductive relation is universally true
  \item Every non-empty set has a minimal element
  \item No infinite sequence is decreasing
\end{itemize}



\section{Open research questions}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Sufficient conditions for reversing the implications between notions of
  well-foundedness?
  \item Knaster-Tarski Lemma: Most general form? Alternative formulations?
  \item Syntax for closure operators allowing to prove the needed properties
  uniformly/generically
\end{enumerate}

\section{To Do}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Clean up the current development
  \item More laws about closure operations: Monotonicity, idempotency
  \item Refactor the ARS formalized results with the new development
  \item Knaster--Tarski in a well-founded setting: what additional
  hypotheses are necessary?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Questions about well-foundedness}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item For a given element $x$, is the property of
  being accessible $\lnot\lnot$-closed? I.E.,
  Does $x$ being $\lnot\lnot$-accessible imply that $x$ is accessible?
  (Conjecture: No.)

  \item As a special case, does being weakly (accessible) well-founded imply being $\lnot\lnot$-wellfounded?
  (Conjecture: No.)

  Also: Same question about inductive notion of well-foundedness.

  \item ($\star$) Given a well-founded relation, does every non-empty subset
  have a minimal element?

  \emph{Problem.} Need to decide whether, for a given $x \in U$,
   the set $\{y | Ryx\}$ is empty.

   \item IF every non-empty subset has a minimal element, does this imply
   either of the weak forms of well-foundedness: $\mathtt{isWFacc-}$ or
   $\mathtt{isWFind-}$ ?

   \item Does $\mathtt{isWFmin-}$ imply $\mathtt{isWFacc-}$ or $\mathtt{isWFind-}$?

   \emph{Problem.} Need to go from $\lnot (\forall y. R y d \to \phi y)$
   and $\forall y. R y d \to \lnot \lnot \phi y$ to $\bot$.

   In terms of accessibility, it should suffices to assume accessibility is
   $\lnot\lnot$-closed, since being related to y is not relevant for that. (?)

   \item Does sequential well-foundedness (no decreasing sequence) imply
   any of the other notions, e.g., \texttt{WFmin-} ?

   \emph{Note.}  This seems to require the most classical assumptions:
   $\lnot\lnot$-closure of $\phi$, relativized De Morgan law,
   Markov's principle, etc.

   \item (2024.10.10) Is being $R$-WN inductive?
   \item (2024.10.10) Does $R$ being finitely branching imply
   that, for an inductive $\phi$, if $\lnot \phi(x)$ then
   $\exists y. Rxy \land \lnot \phi(y)$?

\end{enumerate}

\textsc{Remark.}
$\lnot\lnot$-closure of accessibility should solve problems 1 and 4.
